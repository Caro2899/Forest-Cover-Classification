K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors for Forest Cover Classification

Introduction
The Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado is characterized by clusters of varying tree species (also known as Forest Covers). It has been found that cartographic data (or the information used to draw maps) can be reliable indicators for the kinds of tree species found in specific parts of the forest.

In this PA, we will use cartographic data to categorize the Forest Cover Types over parts of the Roosevelt National Forest. Cartographic data include features such as elevation and proximity to water, which are strong indicators of the kind of fauna in that area. Nonetheless, given that we are dealing with geographical information, it is helpful to use an algorithm that acknowledges distance. This PA proposes using K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors for Forest Cover classification.

Data Source
The data used in this PA was retrieved from a Kaggle competition: Forest Cover Type prediction. You can click the link to learn more about the data. However, this PA uses a slightly modified version of the dataset found on Kaggle.
